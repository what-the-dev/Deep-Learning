# Deep-Learning
A collection of deep learning notebooks. The majority of this work is to put into practice what I have learnt through the [fast.ai deep](https://course.fast.ai/) learning course

If you have trouble viewing the notebooks in here, please use [NB Viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) 

### big_cats
- Building a model to discern the difference between *Lions* and *Tigers*.

### cheetah_leopard
- A slightly harder cat problem, building a model to discern the difference between *Cheetahs* and *Leopards*.
